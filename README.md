# VUE-SHOP v1.0.0  
  
Just a simple shop using **Vue 2**, **Vuex**, **Vue-Router**.  
Additional libraries are **lodash**.  
[Here](https://ruzzhammer.github.io/vue-shop) you can see how it is working.  
This one was made during a free course from OZON in 2021 as one of homework assignments.  
The design was made up.
